The task of this project was to develop a study platform to allow logged in users, to share and access multimedia learning content or study resources. The application would allow any client to browse the existing library of study resources, and exclusively logged in users would be able to post comments in persisting comment threads unique to each post.

Each study resource also had its own dynamic routing page to display a single study resource and also allowed for liking / disliking a post and commenting.
